# -isc_sef_python_programming
Welcome to the ISC SEF Python Programming exercises repository!
This repository contains Python solutions to a set of foundational exercises focused on core programming concepts including functions, recursion, loops, conditionals, modularity, and error handling.

Each problem is solved using clean, PEP8-compliant code, tested with pylint to ensure a perfect score of 10.0/10.0

    Repository Guidelines

    All exercises are implemented in individual Python scripts.

    Pylint is used to ensure code quality, aiming for a score of 10/10.

    Input validation and error handling are implemented where necessary.

    Scripts are standalone, modular, and testable.

    Each folder contains a README describing the approach to solving the exercises.

0xpython_programming_functions

This folder focuses on Python functions and modular programming.

Exercise Approach Summary:

    Student Grades: Convert student marks to letter grades, handling invalid marks, and returning a dictionary of results.

    Fibonacci Series: Generate the first n Fibonacci numbers using a function and return them as a list.

    Simple Calculator: Build a calculator with modular functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulo. Handle division by zero and variable operands.

    Palindrome Checker: Check whether a string is a palindrome with a boolean result.

    Recursive Factorial: Calculate factorials recursively with input validation for negative numbers.

    Even List: Generate a list of even numbers within a given range, handling cases where the start is greater than the stop.

1x_python_programming_file_handling

This folder focuses on file reading, writing, and analysis.

Exercise Approach Summary:

    Log Analyzer: Read logs.txt and count occurrences of [INFO], [ERROR], and [WARNING]. Return results in a dictionary format.

    Word Counter: Read sample.txt and calculate total words and characters. Ensure accurate counting of text content.

    Append to File: Append new text to sample.txt without overwriting existing content, saving results in a new file sample0.txt.
