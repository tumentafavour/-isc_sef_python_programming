Welcome to the ISC SEF Python Programming exercises repository!
This repository contains Python solutions to a set of foundational exercises focused on core programming concepts including functions, recursion, loops, conditionals, modularity, and error handling.

Each problem is solved using clean, PEP8-compliant code, tested with pylint to ensure a perfect score of 10.0/10.0
